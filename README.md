# Completely Reusable Garbled Circuit (CRGC) Generator C++ Version 


Transform C++ functions and boolean circuits stored in [Bristol Fashion](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~nsmart/MPC/) into CRGCs. Our program can transform high-level source code to a CRGC using:
1. Any C++ file imported into this library
2. Any boolean circuit compiled from C++ code using [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit)
3. Any boolean circuit compiled from C code using [CBMC-GC-2](https://gitlab.com/securityengineering/CBMC-GC-2/-/tree/master)


Reusable garbled circuits constructed by this program do not rely on oblivious transfer or double encryption of each gate's truth table. Instead, we use different obfuscation techniques to obfuscate the circuit and the generator's secret input. 

Compared to Yao's Garbled Circuit protocol, the advantages are more efficient circuit evaluation and reusability of the constructed circuit for an arbitrary amount of evaluator inputs. The disadvantage of our approach is that a constructed circuit may leak some secret input bits and unobfuscated gates of the circuit to the evaluator. 

The generator can predict the leakage from a CRGC, assuming the worst case that the evaluator knows the exact construction of the boolean circuit beforehand. 
The generator executable (party A) performs the following steps:

1. It imports a C++ function and converts it to a boolean circuit or imports a boolean circuit directly.
2. It analyzes the leakage that a CRGC will have. It calculates how many gates can be perfectly obfuscated (zero-knowledge) and which input bits may be leaked when an evaluator obtains the transformed circuit. 
3. It transforms the boolean circuit into a CRGC through different obfuscation techniques. It obfuscates party A's input.
4. It evaluates the CRGC with party A's obfuscated input and the sample plain input for party B.
5. It sends the CRGC to the evaluator via network sockets or saves it as a local file. Optionally, it can compress the CRGC before sending or storing it.

The evaluator (party B) performs the following steps:

1. It receives or imports a CRGC and obfuscated input of party A.
2. It evaluates the CRGC with any plain input from party B.
3. It compresses and stores the CRGC for future use.

## Results

We provide a set of circuits as an example. The **src/circuits** folder contains basic boolean circuits stored in bristol fashion: **adder64**, **sub64**, and **sha256**. The **src/programs** folder contains C++ files implementing example programs such as Set Intersection and Linear Search.

### Executables explained 

#### generator executable
```
./generator --circuit=myCPPFunction --type=cpp --inputa=200 --threads=40 --network=compressed --compression=30
```

Act as the **generator**. Transforms my **myCPPFunction.cpp** from the program folder with secret input **200** of party A into a CRGC using **40** Threads. Tests the integrity of the circuit's logic with a random input assumed to be from party B. Then, the generator listens to a connection from the evaluator. If it's connected successfully, the generator transfers the generated obfuscated circuit with its obfuscated input A in **compressed** format. The circuit is compressed using **30** threads.


```
./generator --circuit=adder64 --type=txt --format=bristol --network=compressed 
```

Import the boolean circuit **adder64** stored as a **txt** file in **bristol** fashion. Convert it to a CRGC, compress it, and send it over the network to the evaluator.

#### evalator executable

```
./evaluator --circuit=myCircuit --inputb=20 --network=compressed --store=bin
```
Act as the **evaluator**. Receive a **compressed** CRGC from the generator over the network. Evaluate the circuit with an evaluator input of **20**. Store the CRGC as a **.bin** file on the local hard drive.

```
./evaluator --circuit=myCircuit --inputb=30 --store=bin
```

Act as the **evaluator**. Import the CRGC and obfuscated generator input from the local binary file **./circuits/myCircuit.bin**. Evaluate the circuit with input **30** of Party B.


#### Example Outputs

Convert the **query** C++ function to a CRGC. Send it **uncompressed** over the network to the evaluator.

### Compiling a C++ function to a reusable garbled circuit using our library

You can directly convert C++ functions to a boolean circuit and a CRGC using our library. We use a slightly modified version of [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit). Simply follow these steps:

1. Add your cpp file and header to the **program folder**. include your header in **circuitLinker.cpp**. Look at the existing files for inspiration. Alternatively, you can add your function directly to the **circuitLinker.cpp** file.
2. Link your file to our library by adding it to both the current folder's **CMakeLists.txt** as well as the main directory's target_link_libraries (line 61 in **CMakeLists.txt**).


Run cmake, make, and the following command to convert your program into a CRGC:  
```
./generator --circuit=<FILENAME OF YOUR CPP FILE> --type=cpp --inputa=<inputA> --threads=<number of Threads>
```



### Compiling a C++ function to a boolean circuit using emp toolkit

You can either follow the installation and setup instructions from [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit) or easier clone [MPC-SoK](https://github.com/MPC-SoK/frameworks). MPC-Sok contains a Docker container that installs and sets up emp. 

Clone [MPC-SoK](https://github.com/MPC-SoK/frameworks) and run the following instructions in the **emp folder**.

```
docker build -t emp .
docker run -it --rm emp
cd sh_test
cd test
```
Add your C++ code in a separate file in the **test folder**.

```
$ echo "FILENAME OF YOUR CODE" >> CMakeLists.txt
$ make
```
From the **sh_test folder** run:
```
./bin/"FILENAME OF YOUR CODE" -m
```
This saves a boolean circuit.txt file that you can use to generate a reusable garbled circuit. Save it to the **circuits folder** of this project and run:


```
./generator --circuit=<FILENAME OF YOUR CIRCUIT FILE> --type=txt --inputa=<inputA> --format=emp --threads=<number of Threads>
```

### Compiling a C function to a reusable garbled circuit using CBMC-GC2

You can either follow the installation and setup instructions from [CBMC-GC-2](https://gitlab.com/securityengineering/CBMC-GC-2/-/tree/master) or clone [MPC-SoK](https://github.com/MPC-SoK/frameworks). In this case, both options are straightforward. MPC-Sok contains a Docker container that installs and sets up CBMC-GC-2.

Clone the [CBMC-GC-2 GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/securityengineering/CBMC-GC-2/-/tree/master) and run the following instructions inside the **main folder**:

```
make minisat2-download
make
```

Cd into the **examples folder** and add a folder for your C program. Add your main.c file and this [Makefile](https://github.com/chart21/Reusable-Garbled-Circuit-Generator/blob/main/CBMC-GC-2_MAKEFILE/MAKEFILE) to the folder.

```
cd examples
cd YOURFOLDER
ADD main.c and MAKEFILE
make
```

This saves a bristol_circuit.txt file that you can use to generate a CRGC. Save it to the **circuits folder** of this project and run:

```
./generator --circuit=<FILENAME OF YOUR CIRCUIT FILE> --type=txt --inputa=<inputA>  --format=bristol --threads=<number of Threads>
```
